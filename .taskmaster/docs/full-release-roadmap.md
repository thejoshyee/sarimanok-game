## Pricing Strategy

### Research-Based Recommendations

**Market Data (2024-2025):**
- Indie survivors typically price $2.99-$9.99
- EA games average $19.73 (but that includes larger games)
- Roguelites/survivors often launch $5-$15
- Price increases at 1.0 are expected and accepted

**Your Pricing Plan:**

| Stage | Price | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| EA Launch | $2.99 | Low barrier, matches VS/Void Scrappers EA price |
| Update 2 | $2.99 | Keep price during active development |
| 1.0 Release | $4.99 | Standard for complete indie survivor |
| Post-1.0 (lots of content) | $6.99 | Optional, if content substantially exceeds expectations |

**Key Principle:** Don't raise price until content justifies it. Players accept price increases with substantial updates.

**Discount Strategy:**
- 10-15% launch discount for EA
- 20-25% discount during Steam sales
- Full price around major updates (when new players arrive)

---

## Title Recommendations

### Research Findings on Game Titles

**Best Practices (from industry analysis):**

1. **Keep it short** - 1-3 words ideal, easily searchable
2. **Make it memorable** - Unique words help SEO
3. **Avoid generic words** - "Rise", "Fall", "Shadow", "Origins" are overused
4. **Colons are falling out of favor** - Modern titles often drop them
5. **Genre clarity helps** - "Survivor" instantly communicates gameplay

### Title Options Analyzed

| Title | Pros | Cons | Rating |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| **Sarimanok Survivor** | Genre-clear, short, memorable unique word | Less dramatic | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Sarimanok: Night of the Aswang** | Dramatic, culturally rich, evocative | 6 words, harder to remember, colon | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Night of the Aswang** | Accessible, no hard words | Loses Sarimanok identity, generic "Night of" | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Sarimanok Rising** | Short, dramatic | "Rising" is overused | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Aswang Survivor** | Genre-clear, accessible main word | Loses Sarimanok identity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### Recommendation: **Sarimanok Survivor**

**Why:**
1. **Genre clarity** - "Survivor" tells players exactly what it is
2. **Unique hook** - "Sarimanok" is distinctive and searchable
3. **Short** - 2 words, easy to type, remember, recommend
4. **Follows proven pattern** - Vampire Survivors, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, etc.
5. **Filipino identity preserved** - Sarimanok IS the cultural hook

**Alternative if you want subtitle:** "Sarimanok Survivor: Aswang Night" (keeps it shorter)

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't use "Night of the [X]" - generic horror formula
- Don't use colon with long subtitle - harder to remember/type
- Don't drop "Sarimanok" - it's your unique selling point

## Competitor Analysis

### Direct Competitors (Survivor Roguelites)

| Game | Characters | Weapons | Stages | Price | Dev Team |
|------|------------|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| Vampire Survivors | 50+ | 100+ | 27 | $4.99 | Small team |
| Brotato | 62 | 50+ | 1* | $4.99 | Solo |
| Void Scrappers | 10+ | 20+ | 1* | $2.99 | Solo |
| Deep Rock Survivor | 4 | 40+ | Many | $9.99 | Studio |
| **Sarimanok (EA)** | 3 | 6 | 1 | $2.99 | 1-2 |
| **Sarimanok (1.0)** | 6-8 | 12-15 | 3-4 | $4.99 | 1-2 |

*Brotato/Void Scrappers use wave-based progression rather than distinct stages

### Your Unique Differentiation

1. **Cultural niche** - Only Filipino folklore survivor game
2. **Clear win condition** - Survive to dawn (narrative closure)
3. **Sarimanok protagonist** - Visually distinctive, not generic
4. **Price point** - Competitive with best-in-class

## Summary: When Is Sarimanok "Done"?

### EA Launch (March 2026) ✓

Ship with current PRD scope. This is a **complete game experience** with:
- 30-minute runs with win condition
- 3 characters
- Full progression loop
- Polish and juice

### 1.0 Release (~Summer 2026)

Ship when you have:
- 3-4 stages
- 6+ characters
- 12+ weapons
- 3+ bosses
- All feedback addressed
- Full polish

### "Living Game" (Ongoing)

Continue adding content as long as:
- Players want more
- Revenue supports development
- You're having fun

**Key insight:** The game is "done" when it delivers a complete, polished experience - not when it matches Vampire Survivors' content. VS had years and massive success to build that library. Your game needs to be good, not biggest.
