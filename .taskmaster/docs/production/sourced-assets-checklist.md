## ⚠️ TWO-PHASE STORE PAGE STRATEGY

Your store page needs to be **LIVE by Dec 28-30** for Next Fest registration (Jan 5 deadline).
You won't have final art yet - that's okay! Launch with placeholders, upgrade later.

### Phase 1: Placeholder Launch (Week 4 - Dec 28-30)

| Asset                | Placeholder Option                        | Cost    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Main Capsule 616×353 | Simple design: Title + background         | $50-100 |
| Small Capsule        | Scaled from main                          | $0      |
| Header Capsule       | Scaled from main                          | $0      |
| Screenshots (5+)     | Greybox/placeholder gameplay              | $0      |
| Description          | Written text (see `steam-store-draft.md`) | $0      |

**Phase 1 Goal:** Get store page LIVE so you can register for Next Fest.

### Phase 2: Polish Before Next Fest (Week 8-10 - by Feb 9)

| Asset            | Polished Version                       | Cost     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Main Capsule     | Professional commissioned illustration | $200-400 |
| All Capsules     | Matching professional set              | included |
| Screenshots (5+) | Final gameplay with real art           | $0       |
| Trailer          | 30-60 sec gameplay video               | $0       |

**Phase 2 Goal:** Make store page shine before Next Fest begins (Feb 23).
