> **Critical:** First 4 screenshots appear in hover preview - make them count!

| Order | Content                              | Purpose                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1     | Sarimanok surrounded by enemies      | Shows core gameplay      |
| 2     | Level-up screen with weapon choices  | Shows progression system |
| 3     | Manananggal boss encounter           | Shows excitement/stakes  |

## Trailer Best Practices

| Rule                          | Why It Matters                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Gameplay in first 4-5 sec     | First trailer is used for hover-over clips          |
| NO logos/title cards at start | Wastes precious seconds - show gameplay immediately |
| Under 60 seconds total        | Attention spans are short - be punchy               |
| ONE trailer in primary slot   | Multiple trailers split attention and add noise     |
| Show core mechanics           | Demonstrate how the game is played, not tutorials   |

## Steam Tags (Set in Steamworks)

> **Important:** Top 5 tags carry the most algorithmic weight. Be specific!

| Priority | Tag              | Why                                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Roguelite        | Core genre - players search for this   |
| 2        | Action Roguelike | Secondary genre term                   |
| 3        | Bullet Hell      | Describes the gameplay style           |
| 4        | Pixel Art        | Visual style - attracts pixel art fans |
| 5        | Survivors        | Sub-genre (if available as tag)        |
| 6        | Single Player    | Important for filtering                |
| 7        | Mythology        | Cultural hook - differentiator         |
| 8        | Indie            | Lower priority - too generic           |

**Tag Maintenance:**

- After launch, audit user-submitted tags in Steamworks
- Flag irrelevant or misleading tags
- Monitor which tags drive the most relevant traffic
