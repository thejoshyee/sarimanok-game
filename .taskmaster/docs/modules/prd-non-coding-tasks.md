**1. HIGHEST PRIORITY - Classic Sarimanok (Week 1-2)**

- [ ] Classic Sarimanok sprite (32×32, 2 frames)
  - Rainbow/vibrant colors (reference Maranao traditional art)
  - Decorative tail plumes, distinctive crest, proud posture
  - Strong silhouette over intricate details at 32×32
  - Est. time: 3-4 hours
- **DEMO BLOCKER:** Classic Sarimanok must be ready for Next Fest demo

---

### 2. Character Variants (Week 2-3)

- [ ] Shadow Sarimanok sprite (32×32, 2 frames)
  - Dark purple/blue recolor of Classic
  - Est. time: 1 hour
- [ ] Golden Sarimanok sprite (32×32, 2 frames)
  - Gold/red/bronze recolor of Classic
  - Est. time: 1 hour

- [ ] Manananggal Boss sprite (48×48, 4 frames)
  - Flying torso vampire with bat wings
  - Grotesque but readable silhouette
  - Dark red/black/pale skin
  - Est. time: 5-7 hours
  - **FALLBACK:** Static 48×48 sprite (1 frame only) if time-limited
    - Still reads as "big scary boss"
    - Just add bob up/down animation in code

---

### 4. Weapon Icons & Effects (Week 5-6)

**Icons (16×16 each):**

- [ ] Peck icon - Est. 30 min

- [ ] Spiral Feathers icon - Est. 30 min
- [ ] Ice Shard icon (blue recolor of Feather Shot) - Est. 15 min
- [ ] Flame Wing icon (orange recolor of Wing Slap) - Est. 15 min

**Effects:**

### Art Checkpoints & Contingency

| Week   | Required Art                      | Action if Not Ready                                 |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 4 | Classic Sarimanok + Green Duwende | Josh creates backup art OR use upscaled 16×16 pack  |
| Week 5 | Red Duwende + Santelmo            | Use recolors OR upscaled pack                       |
| Week 6 | Manananggal + All Icons           | Use static boss sprite (1 frame) + asset pack icons |

**16×16 Fallback Strategy:**

- Asset pack available with Filipino creatures at 16×16
- Upscale to 32×32 using [Lospec Pixel Art Scaler](https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/) (2×)
- Zero code changes needed - maintains pixel aesthetic

**Manananggal Fallback:**

- If 4-frame animation blocks progress, use static 48×48 sprite
- Add bob up/down in code with simple tween
- Saves 4-5 hours, still reads as boss

---

### Art Integration (Week 8)

- [ ] Export all sprites from Aseprite as PNG
- [ ] Organize in `/art/` folder with clear naming
- [ ] Provide to Josh for integration
- [ ] Review integrated sprites in-game
- [ ] Provide feedback on any adjustments needed

**IMPORTANT:** Baby due March 21. Completing core art by Week 6 (mid-January) gives 8+ weeks buffer. Tileset and UI polish can happen in Weeks 7-8 if able, but are NOT blockers.

---

## 🎵 Audio Tasks

### Week 1: Audio Sourcing (START EARLY!)

**SFX Pack Purchase:**

- [ ] Buy Fantasy/RPG SFX pack ($15-30)
  - Gamedev Market, Humble Bundle, or Sonniss GDC Audio (free)
  - Look for: Hit sounds, death sounds, pickup sounds, UI clicks
  - Cohesive pack > hunting individual sounds

**Music Browsing (Start Now, Finalize Week 9):**

- [ ] Browse Pixabay Music (free, no attribution)
  - Search: "chiptune night," "pixel game action," "boss battle"
- [ ] Browse OpenGameArt (free, game-focused)
- [ ] Note: Finding right vibe takes time - don't wait until Week 9!

**Backup Plan:**

- [ ] If no good matches found, commission on Fiverr ($50-150 for 4 tracks)
  - Brief: "Filipino-inspired chiptune/pixel art game music, night survival theme, boss battle intensity"

---

### Week 9: Final Audio Integration

**Music Selection (4 tracks needed):**

- [ ] Menu theme - Calm, Filipino-inspired
- [ ] Night theme (gameplay) - Tense, action
- [ ] Boss theme (20:00+) - Intense, dramatic
- [ ] Victory jingle - Triumphant, Sarimanok crow

**Filipino-Specific Sounds (CRITICAL - Don't use generic!):**

- [ ] Sarimanok crow sound
  - NOT generic rooster - mystical bird cry
  - Research Filipino rooster sounds OR commission unique sound
- [ ] COCKADOODLEDOO victory sound (signature moment!)
- [ ] Manananggal screech (boss audio signature)
- [ ] Tiktik clicking sound (aswang presence indicator from folklore)
  - Use for night ambience

**SFX Replacement:**

- [ ] Replace all placeholder SFX with final polished sounds
  - Peck, Wing Slap, Feather Shot, Spiral Feathers
  - Enemy hit, enemy death
  - XP pickup, Gold pickup
  - Level up
  - Menu click

**Audio Implementation Checklist:**

- [ ] All sounds use pitch randomization (±10-15% variance)
  - CRITICAL for repetitive sounds (enemy hit plays 10,000+ times)
  - Prevents ear fatigue
- [ ] Audio respects volume settings from Settings menu
- [ ] Music crossfades between tracks (0.5 second transitions)
- [ ] Max 8 sounds playing simultaneously

---

## 📢 Marketing & Wishlist Building

### Target: 7,000+ wishlists before Feb 23, 2026

**Realistic Check:** This is ASPIRATIONAL. Many successful EA games launch with 2,000-5,000. Do NOT delay launch to hit this number.

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk: Art Takes Too Long (Baby Timeline)

**Mitigation:**

- Classic Sarimanok FIRST (demo blocker)
- Use 2-frame animations only (minimal)
- Recolors instead of new sprites (Shadow/Golden)
- 16×16 asset pack + Lospec upscaler as fallback
- Static Manananggal (1 frame) acceptable if needed
- Accept "good enough" over perfect

**Checkpoint:** Week 6 art deadline. If not met, switch to backup plan immediately.

---

### Risk: Store Page Verification Delays

**Mitigation:**

- Started TODAY (Dec 3) - 4+ weeks buffer
- Monitor verification status daily
- Follow up with Steam Support after 5 business days
- Store page can launch with placeholders if needed

**Worst Case:** If verification stalls, commission someone on Fiverr to help troubleshoot ($50-100).

---

### Risk: Wishlist Goals Not Met

**Mitigation:**

- 7,000 is ASPIRATIONAL, not required
- 2,000-5,000 wishlists is still viable for EA
- Low price point ($2.99-4.99) enables impulse purchases
- Do NOT delay launch for wishlist numbers

**Reality Check:** Filipino community + cultural hook may create viral spread. But even without virality, game is viable at low wishlist count due to price.

---

### Risk: Commissioned Capsule Art Quality/Timing

**Mitigation:**

- Review artist portfolio carefully before commissioning
- Ericka can create backup illustration (4-6 hours)
- Can launch with refined placeholder if needed
- Professional typography + gradient + sprite composite works

**Backup Timeline:**

- Week 6: Commission with 10 business day deadline
- Week 7: Follow up if no progress
- Week 8: If not delivered, switch to Ericka/backup plan

---

### Risk: No Press/Influencer Coverage

**Mitigation:**

- Filipino community is PRIMARY channel, not press
- Organic social media can drive wishlists alone
- Steam Next Fest provides built-in visibility
- Low price point reduces need for big media coverage

**Reality:** Most indie games get zero press. That's OK. Community + Next Fest + word-of-mouth is the real strategy.

## 📝 Notes & Reminders

### General Guidelines

**Art Philosophy:**

- Functionality over polish
- Strong silhouettes over intricate details at 32×32
- 2-frame animations acceptable for EA
- Placeholder art is SHIPPABLE
- Real art is "Should Have," not "Must Have"

**Steam Store Philosophy:**

- Launch with placeholders, polish iteratively
- Store page is NEVER "done" - always improving
- First 4 screenshots most critical (hover preview)
- Capsule art = single most important marketing asset
- Good enough to launch > perfect but late

**Marketing Philosophy:**

- Cultural hook (Sarimanok, Filipino creatures) is unique advantage
- Filipino diaspora is underserved market
- Personal story (first-time dev, baby coming) is relatable
- Show, don't tell - GIFs > walls of text
- Engagement > follower count

**Timeline Philosophy:**

- Baby due March 21 = HARD STOP
- 2-week buffer is intentional, don't erode it
- "Good enough" is good enough for EA
- Post-launch updates can add polish
- Shipping > perfection
