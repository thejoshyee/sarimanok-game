# Steam Next Fest Timeline

## Critical Deadlines

| Date       | Deadline                            | Action Required                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Jan 5**  | Registration deadline               | Register with live "Coming Soon" store page     |
| **Feb 9**  | Final submission deadline           | Demo + store page must be ready for review      |
| **Feb 23** | Next Fest begins                    | Set demo LIVE at 10am PDT                       |
| Mar 2      | Next Fest ends                      | Wrap-up featuring most-played demos             |
| **~Mar 8** | EA Launch                           | Right after Next Fest - ride the wishlist wave! |

## Why This Timing is Perfect

1. **Maximum exposure:** Thousands of players browse Next Fest demos
2. **Wishlist conversion:** Players try demo → wishlist → get notified on launch → buy
3. **Immediate launch:** EA launches right after Next Fest while wishlists are hot
4. **Filipino community:** Share demo in communities during Next Fest week
5. **Streamer coverage:** More likely to try free demos than paid games

# Steam Store Page Optimization

Your Steam store page is a sales funnel: capsule → screenshots → trailer → description → tags → wishlist/buy.

## Required Assets

**Capsule Art (CRITICAL):**

| Asset          | Size         | Priority     | Notes                                |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Main Capsule   | 616×353 px   | **CRITICAL** | Appears in search, browse, Next Fest |
| Small Capsule  | 231×87 px    | Required     | Shows in wishlists, library          |
| Header Capsule | 460×215 px   | Required     | Shows on store page header           |
| Library Hero   | 3840×1240 px | Nice-to-have | Shows in Steam library (big mode)    |
| Library Logo   | 1280×720 px  | Nice-to-have | Shows in Steam library               |

**Capsule Art Recommendation:**
- **Commission professional illustration** (~$200-400 from Fiverr/ArtStation) - RECOMMENDED
- Do NOT use scaled pixel art (looks amateur at Steam's display sizes)
- Feature Sarimanok prominently, night atmosphere, action/energy feel

**Screenshots (Minimum 5):**

**First 4 screenshots are CRITICAL** (appear in hover preview):

1. **Screenshot 1:** Sarimanok surrounded by enemies (core gameplay)
2. **Screenshot 2:** Level-up screen with weapon choices (progression)
3. **Screenshot 3:** Manananggal boss encounter (stakes/excitement)
4. **Screenshot 4:** Multiple weapons firing at once (power fantasy)
5. **Screenshot 5:** Shop screen or character select (depth)

**Trailer Best Practices:**

| Rule                          | Why It Matters                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Gameplay in first 4-5 sec     | First trailer used for hover-over clips         |
| NO logos/title cards at start | Wastes precious seconds - show gameplay now     |
| Under 60 seconds total        | Attention spans are short - be punchy           |
| ONE trailer in primary slot   | Multiple trailers split attention and add noise |
| Show core mechanics           | Demonstrate gameplay, not tutorials             |

## Steam Tags Strategy

**Top 5 tags carry the most algorithmic weight.** Set these in Steamworks:

| Priority | Tag              | Why                                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Roguelite        | Core genre - players search for this   |
| 2        | Action Roguelike | Secondary genre term                   |
| 3        | Bullet Hell      | Describes the gameplay style           |
| 4        | Pixel Art        | Visual style - attracts pixel art fans |
| 5        | Survivors        | Sub-genre (if available as tag)        |
| 6        | Single Player    | Important for filtering                |
| 7        | Mythology        | Cultural hook - differentiator         |
| 8        | Indie            | Lower priority - too generic           |

**After launch:** Audit user-submitted tags in Steamworks, flag irrelevant tags.
