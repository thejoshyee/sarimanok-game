# Week 13: NEXT FEST (February 23 - March 2)

**End State: "Demo is LIVE, collecting wishlists!"**

**Steam Next Fest runs February 23 - March 2, 2026**

This is the biggest marketing event. Thousands of players browse and try demos. Your goal: **maximize wishlists**.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Set demo LIVE on February 23 at 10am PDT (Next Fest start)**
- [ ] Monitor demo feedback and bug reports (Steam discussions)
- [ ] Engage in Steam discussions (respond to questions, thank players for feedback)
- [ ] Post about Next Fest participation to Filipino gaming communities:
  - r/Philippines
  - r/PHGamers
  - Filipino Discord servers
  - Filipino Facebook gaming groups
- [ ] Track wishlist growth daily during Next Fest
- [ ] Fix any **CRITICAL** bugs found in demo (game-breaking only)
  - Hot-patch if necessary (demo can be updated during fest)
- [ ] Prepare EA launch announcement (finalize copy)
- [ ] Final polish based on Next Fest feedback (if time permits)
- [ ] Monitor streamer/YouTuber coverage (share good clips)

## What NOT to Do During Next Fest

- **Don't add features** - focus on bug fixes only
- **Don't over-promise** - stick to what the game delivers
- **Don't argue with negative feedback** - thank them and note issues
- **Don't panic** - demo bugs are normal, fix critical ones only

## Wishlist Targets

**Realistic:** 500-1,000 wishlists during Next Fest week
**Stretch:** 2,000+ wishlists (requires viral spread or streamer coverage)

**Remember:** Even 500 wishlists converts to 100-150 launch week sales at typical 20-30% conversion rates.

**Integration Test:** Demo works for thousands of players, wishlist count growing
