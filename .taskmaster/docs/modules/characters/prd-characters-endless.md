# Sarimanok Survivor - Endless Mode & MVP Checkpoint (Week 6)

## Project Context

- **Genre:** Filipino folklore-themed survivor roguelite
- **Platform:** Windows (Godot 4.x, GDScript)
- **Art Style:** Top-down pixel art (32x32 sprites, 640×360 viewport)
- **Timeline:** phase-based, no fixed dates — see CLAUDE.md

# Feature 12: Endless Mode

**What It Does:**
Unlocks after beating Story Mode. No time limit—survive as long as possible. Uses same difficulty scaling as Story Mode (spawn rate + stat scaling already implemented from Weeks 1-3).

**Why It's Important:**
Replayability after beating Story Mode. Leaderboard appeal. Adds value without significant development time (reuses all existing systems).

## Unlock Condition

```
Beat Story Mode (survive to 30:00)
    ↓
"ENDLESS MODE UNLOCKED!" notification
    ↓
Endless Mode button appears on main menu
```

## Endless Mode Rules (Simplified EA Version)

- Timer counts UP forever (no 30:00 win condition)
- Same spawn rate scaling as Story Mode (continues past 30:00)
- Same HP/damage scaling as Story Mode (continues past 30:00)
- You WILL eventually die (no win condition)
- Goal: Survive as long as possible

**No additional scaling needed:** The exponential spawn rate formula and stat scaling from Weeks 1-3 already provide infinite difficulty progression.

**Before unlock:** Show 🔒 and "Beat Story Mode to unlock"
**After unlock:** Show ✓ and allow selection

## Leaderboards

| Mode         | Leaderboard   |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Story Mode   | High Score    |
| Endless Mode | Time Survived |

## Technical Requirements

- Check if Story Mode has been beaten (endless_unlocked flag)
- Add Endless Mode button to main menu (locked initially)
- Disable 30:00 victory condition for Endless Mode (`GameTimer` currently hardcodes `VICTORY_TIME` — needs a mode flag)
- Mode-aware HUD timer: Story Mode shows a countdown to dawn (decided 2026-07-22, as built in `hud.gd`); Endless must count UP past 30:00 — `hud.gd` currently floors the countdown at 00:00 and needs a mode switch
- Track best time for Endless Mode separately
- Display best time on main menu
- Reuse ALL existing systems (enemies, weapons, scaling)

## Endless Mode Flow

```
Player selects Endless Mode
    ↓
Character select screen (same as Story Mode)
    ↓
Run starts (identical to Story Mode)
    ↓
Timer counts up forever
    ↓
No victory at 30:00 (just keep going)
    ↓
Player eventually dies
    ↓
Results screen shows time survived
    ↓
Update best time if new record
```

## Save File Updates

**Canonical schema:** [prd-progression-state.md §Save Data Format](../progression/prd-progression-state.md) — do not duplicate the JSON here. This module's keys: `endless_unlocked`, `high_score_endless`, `best_time_endless` (float seconds, formatted only at display).

## Implementation Notes

**What's different from Story Mode:**

- No victory condition at 30:00 (just keep spawning enemies)
- Track separate high score and best time
- Display "Endless Mode" label in HUD

**What's the same:**

- All enemies, weapons, passives
- Level-up system
- Shop bonuses apply
- Spawn rate formula (continues scaling past 30:00)
- Enemy stat scaling (continues past 30:00)
- Gold earned persists
