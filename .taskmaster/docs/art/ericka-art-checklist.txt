                    ERICKA'S ART PRIORITY CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Work on these in order! Check off as you complete each one.
Josh is coding in parallel - he'll use placeholders until your art is ready.

Total Estimated Time: 18-24 hours
Target Completion: Week 6 (before baby buffer)


================================================================================
HOW WEAPONS WORK - READ THIS FIRST!
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: In survivor games like Vampire Survivors, the player character
NEVER animates attacking. The Sarimanok just bobs/walks - that's it.
Weapons are SEPARATE visual effects that spawn around or shoot from the
player automatically.

Think of it like this:
- The Sarimanok sprite only has 2 frames (bob up/down)
- Weapons are independent sprites that appear/disappear on cooldowns
- The code spawns these weapon effects - you just draw what they look like

Example from Vampire Survivors:
- Garlic = expanding circle appears around player (AOE)
- Knife = small knife sprite shoots forward (projectile)
- Bible = book sprites orbit around the player (orbital)
- Whip = slash effect appears in direction player faces (melee)


================================================================================
PHASE 1: PLAYER CHARACTERS (5-6 hours total)
================================================================================

[ ] sarimanok_classic.aseprite    32x32, 2 frames    ~3-4 hours  ⭐ PRIORITY
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Legendary Maranao bird with rainbow/vibrant colors
    - Key features: decorative fan-like tail plumes, distinctive head crest,
      proud upright posture
    - Reference traditional Maranao okir patterns for color inspiration
    - Colors: Red, orange, yellow, gold, teal accents
    
    ANIMATION (2 frames):
    - Frame 1: Standing neutral
    - Frame 2: Slight bob down (1-2 pixels lower) — creates bounce when walking
    
    DESIGN TIPS:
    - At 32x32, focus on SILHOUETTE over detail
    - The decorative tail is the most recognizable feature
    - Strong black outline for readability
    - Code handles flipping sprite for left/right movement
    
    This is the DEMO character - do this FIRST!


[ ] sarimanok_shadow.aseprite     32x32, 2 frames    ~1 hour (recolor)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Same shape as Classic, different colors
    - Dark purple/midnight blue body
    - Pale violet/silver highlights
    - Glowing red or purple eyes (menacing look)
    - This is the "glass cannon" - fast & deadly but fragile


[ ] sarimanok_golden.aseprite     32x32, 2 frames    ~1 hour (recolor)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Same shape as Classic, different colors
    - Rich gold primary color
    - Bronze and copper tail accents
    - Red highlights
    - This is the "tank" - slow but tough


================================================================================
PHASE 2: ENEMIES (9.5-13.5 hours total)
================================================================================

[ ] duwende_green.aseprite        32x32, 2 frames    ~2-3 hours
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Small goblin/dwarf creature from Filipino folklore
    - Oversized head (takes up ~half the sprite height)
    - Pointy ears sticking out sideways
    - Small squat body, short stubby legs
    - Mischievous expression: large eyes, small grin
    - Colors: Forest green skin, darker green shadows, maybe brown loincloth
    
    ANIMATION (2 frames - waddle walk):
    - Frame 1: Feet apart in standing position
    - Frame 2: Feet together/crossed (mid-step)
    - Creates waddling motion when looped


[ ] duwende_red.aseprite          32x32, 2 frames    ~20 min (recolor)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Same sprite as Green Duwende, just recolored
    - Deep red/burgundy skin
    - Maybe yellow eyes for more aggressive look
    - This variant is more territorial/angry


[ ] santelmo.aseprite             32x32, 2 frames    ~2-3 hours
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Ball of floating fire/light (Saint Elmo's Fire)
    - NO face or creature features - it's pure fire
    - Bright white/yellow core (hottest part)
    - Orange middle ring
    - Red/transparent flame edges
    - Irregular flickering outline
    
    ANIMATION (2 frames - flicker):
    - Frame 1: Flame shape A
    - Frame 2: Different flame outline (shifted tendrils)
    - Plays FAST (0.15s per frame) for fire effect
    - The outline should change between frames - fire doesn't hold shape


[ ] manananggal.aseprite          48x48, 4 frames    ~5-7 hours  ⚠️ HIGH EFFORT
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Flying female torso with bat wings - NO lower body
    - Long flowing black hair
    - Pale/corpse-like skin (gray-white or pale green)
    - Large bat-like wings spanning most of the width
    - Trailing viscera/entrails where body is severed (dark red)
    - Glowing red eyes
    - Grotesque but readable silhouette
    
    ANIMATION (4 frames - wing flap):
    - Frame 1: Wings fully up
    - Frame 2: Wings horizontal (going down)
    - Frame 3: Wings fully down
    - Frame 4: Wings horizontal (going up)
    - Body mostly static, wings do all the movement
    - Hair can sway slightly between frames
    
    FALLBACK: If this is blocking progress, create a static 1-frame sprite
    (saves 4-5 hrs). Can add animation post-launch.


[ ] duwende_black.aseprite        32x32, 2 frames    ~20 min (Update 1 - LATER)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOT FOR EARLY ACCESS - Save for Update 1
    - Recolor of Green Duwende
    - Dark gray/black skin with purple highlights
    - Glowing red or yellow eyes


================================================================================
PHASE 3: WEAPON EFFECTS (2.5-3.5 hours total)
================================================================================

These are the actual attack visuals that spawn during gameplay. The Sarimanok
NEVER animates attacking - these effects just appear/fire automatically.


[ ] feather_projectile.aseprite   16x16, 1 frame     ~30 min
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT IS: A feather that shoots toward enemies (like knife in VS)
    
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Single elegant feather, pointing RIGHT
    - Colorful (matches Sarimanok colors: red/orange/gold)
    - Clear directional shape - must read well when rotated
    - Code handles rotation to aim at enemies
    
    HOW IT WORKS IN-GAME:
    - Spawns at Sarimanok's position
    - Flies toward nearest enemy
    - Can reuse this exact sprite for Spiral Feathers (code rotates it)


[ ] ice_shard_projectile.aseprite 16x16, 1 frame     ~15 min (blue recolor)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT IS: A cold feather that slows enemies
    
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Same shape as Feather Projectile
    - Blue/cyan color palette
    - Maybe add a few ice crystal sparkles
    - Slightly transparent/glowing look


[ ] peck_hit_effect.aseprite      32x32, 2-3 frames  ~1 hour
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT IS: A quick jab in front of the Sarimanok (like whip in VS)
    
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Directional thrust pointing OUTWARD from center
    - NOT a generic impact spark
    - Think: sharp beak strike with motion lines
    - Should clearly show direction of attack
    
    ANIMATION:
    - Frame 1: Thrust appears
    - Frame 2: Thrust extends
    - Frame 3: Thrust fades
    
    Visual:
       Frame 1:        Frame 2:        Frame 3:
          →              →→             →→→
         ──●            ───●           ────●
          →              →→             →→→
       (appears)     (extends)        (fades)
    
    HOW IT WORKS IN-GAME:
    - Spawns in front of Sarimanok (direction they're facing)
    - Quick flash - damages enemies in small cone
    - Very fast animation (appears and disappears quickly)


[ ] wing_slap_circle.aseprite     64x64, 2-3 frames  ~1-2 hours
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT IS: Circular sweep damaging ALL enemies around player (like garlic)
    
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Expanding circular swoosh/wave
    - NOT just a simple circle - needs motion!
    - Radiating lines suggesting outward sweep
    - Feathery/wind-like edges
    
    ANIMATION:
    - Frame 1: Small circle appears
    - Frame 2: Circle expands with motion lines
    - Frame 3: Circle at full size, fading
    
    Visual:
       Frame 1:        Frame 2:        Frame 3:
           ·              \|/            \ | /
          (●)            -(●)-          --(●)--
           ·              /|\            / | \
        (small)       (expanding)     (full size)
    
    HOW IT WORKS IN-GAME:
    - Spawns centered on Sarimanok
    - Expands outward, damaging all nearby enemies
    - Code positions it - you just draw the effect


[ ] flame_wing_circle.aseprite    64x64, 2-3 frames  ~15 min (orange recolor)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT IS: A fiery version of Wing Slap (smaller radius, more damage)
    
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Same animation as Wing Slap Circle
    - Orange/red/yellow fire colors
    - Add flame wisps at the edges
    - Slightly smaller feeling (75% of Wing Slap conceptually)


NOTE: Spiral Feathers needs NO NEW ART!
    - Uses Feather Projectile sprite
    - Code places 4-8 feathers orbiting the Sarimanok
    - Code handles rotation as they circle
    - You don't need to draw anything new for this!


================================================================================
PHASE 4: WEAPON ICONS (2 hours total)
================================================================================

These are 16x16 icons shown in the HUD and level-up screen.
They represent the weapon, not the attack itself.

[ ] peck_icon.aseprite            16x16, 1 frame     ~30 min
    A sharp bird beak pointing right. Show just the beak shape, maybe with
    small motion lines. Think "quick jab."

[ ] wing_slap_icon.aseprite       16x16, 1 frame     ~30 min
    A wing with motion swoosh lines. The wing should look like it's mid-swing.
    Curved motion lines suggest circular sweep.

[ ] feather_shot_icon.aseprite    16x16, 1 frame     ~30 min
    A single feather pointing right. Elegant, flowing feather shape. This is
    also reused for the projectile sprite.

[ ] spiral_feathers_icon.aseprite 16x16, 1 frame     ~30 min
    3-4 small feathers arranged in a circle/spiral pattern. Suggests orbiting.

[ ] ice_shard_icon.aseprite       16x16, 1 frame     ~15 min (recolor)
    Blue recolor of Feather Shot icon. Add blue/cyan tint, maybe ice sparkle.

[ ] flame_wing_icon.aseprite      16x16, 1 frame     ~15 min (recolor)
    Orange/red recolor of Wing Slap icon. Add warm fire colors, flame wisps.


================================================================================
PHASE 5: SHARED ASSETS
================================================================================

[ ] shadow.aseprite               16x8, 1 frame      ~15 min
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHAT IT IS: A simple shadow that goes under ALL characters and enemies
    
    WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:
    - Dark gray or black oval/ellipse
    - ~50% transparent
    - Simple, no detail needed
    
    HOW IT WORKS:
    - Code places this UNDER every character/enemy
    - Character bobs up/down, shadow stays still
    - Creates natural "floating/walking" look
    - Draw once, reused for everything!


================================================================================
PHASE 6: FILIPINO TILES (Optional - 1-2 hours if time allows)
================================================================================

These add cultural flavor but are NOT required. We have asset packs as backup.

[ ] Rice Paddy Tiles (2 variations) - 32x32 each
    Green rice stalks growing from muddy/watery base.

[ ] Bahay Kubo (Background) - 64x64 or larger
    Traditional nipa hut on stilts with warm light in windows.

QUICK REFERENCE - WHAT EACH WEAPON DOES
================================================================================

Weapon            Type        Visual               In-Game Behavior
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peck              Melee       Beak thrust effect   Quick jab in front of player
Wing Slap         AOE         Expanding circle     Damages all enemies around player
Feather Shot      Projectile  Flying feather       Shoots toward nearest enemy
Spiral Feathers   Orbital     Feathers circling    4-8 feathers orbit player constantly
Ice Shard         Projectile  Blue feather         Slower shot, slows enemies on hit
Flame Wing        AOE         Fire circle          Smaller but stronger Wing Slap


================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE - CANVAS SIZES
================================================================================

32x32  = Characters, regular enemies, small effects
48x48  = Boss only (Manananggal)
64x64  = Large AOE effects (wing slap, flame wing)
16x16  = Icons, projectiles, pickups
16x8   = Shadow sprite


================================================================================
ANIMATION FRAMES
================================================================================

2 frames = Simple bob animation (up/down or slight movement)
3 frames = Effects with start/middle/end
4 frames = Boss only (more complex movement)

All animations are HORIZONTAL strips:
  2 frames at 32x32 = export as 64x32 PNG
  4 frames at 48x48 = export as 192x48 PNG


================================================================================
ART STYLE GUIDELINES
================================================================================

- Sprite sizes: 32x32 (characters/enemies), 48x48 (boss), 16x16 (icons)
- Animation: 2 frames for most things, 4 frames for boss
- Colors: 2-3 main colors per sprite, use the Resurrect 64 palette
- Outlines: Black outlines help readability at small sizes
- Test: Always zoom out to see how sprites read at actual game size
- Silhouette: If the shape isn't clear in solid black, redesign it


================================================================================
TIPS
================================================================================

- Start with Sarimanok Classic - it's the most important!
- Recolors are quick wins - do them right after the original
- Save often (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)
- Don't stress about perfection - we can always tweak later
- Check references/ folder for inspiration
- Watch Vampire Survivors gameplay to see how weapon effects work
- Ask Josh if you're unsure about anything!
