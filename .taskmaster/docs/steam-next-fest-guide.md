## ✅ Eligibility Requirements

Your game must meet ALL of these criteria ([source](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/upcoming_events/nextfest/2026february#dates)):

- [ ] Steamworks developer account **in good standing**
- [ ] Store page **published and public** (not just submitted)
- [ ] **NOT** a prologue, chapter 1, or demo of existing content
- [ ] Includes a **publicly playable demo** by Feb 23
- [ ] Releases **after March 2, 2026** (after Next Fest ends)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Games can only participate in **ONE** Next Fest. Choose wisely! The next edition after February 2026 is June 2026.

---

## 🏪 Store Page Requirements

### Must Have Before Registration (Jan 5)

Your store page must be **LIVE** (publicly visible) to register. This means:

- [ ] Steamworks account fully verified (ID + tax info)
- [ ] Store page created and submitted for review
- [ ] Store page **approved and public**
- [ ] "Coming Soon" or "Wishlist" button visible to public

### Capsule Art (CRITICAL)

> ⚠️ Bad capsule = no clicks = no wishlists. This is your most important visual asset.

| Asset          | Size         | Priority     | Notes                                |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Main Capsule   | 616×353 px   | **CRITICAL** | Appears in search, browse, Next Fest |
| Small Capsule  | 231×87 px    | Required     | Shows in wishlists, library          |
| Header Capsule | 460×215 px   | Required     | Shows on store page header           |
| Library Hero   | 3840×1240 px | Nice-to-have | Shows in Steam library (big mode)    |
| Library Logo   | 1280×720 px  | Nice-to-have | Shows in Steam library               |

**Capsule Art Best Practices:**

- Design for small size viewing (616×353 often displayed much smaller)
- High contrast, readable text
- Professional illustration (NOT scaled pixel art)
- Clear game identity visible at thumbnail size
- Budget: $200-400 for commission

### Screenshots (5+ Required)

> **Critical:** First 4 screenshots appear in hover preview - make them count!

| Order | Content                              | Purpose                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1     | Sarimanok surrounded by enemies      | Shows core gameplay      |
| 2     | Level-up screen with weapon choices  | Shows progression system |
| 3     | Manananggal boss encounter           | Shows excitement/stakes  |
| 4     | Multiple weapons firing at once      | Shows power fantasy      |
| 5+    | Shop, character select, environments | Shows depth and variety  |

**Screenshot Requirements:**

- Minimum 5 screenshots (Steam requirement)
- Capture at 1920×1080 minimum resolution
- Show varied gameplay - no repetitive shots
- Include UI elements if they're important features

### Trailer

| Rule                          | Why It Matters                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Gameplay in first 4-5 sec     | First trailer is used for hover-over clips          |
| NO logos/title cards at start | Wastes precious seconds - show gameplay immediately |
| Under 60 seconds total        | Attention spans are short - be punchy               |
| ONE trailer in primary slot   | Multiple trailers split attention and add noise     |
| Show core mechanics           | Demonstrate how the game is played, not tutorials   |

> **For Official Trailer Consideration:** If Steam notifies you on Jan 6 that your demo may be included in the official Next Fest trailer, ensure your latest trailer is uploaded by Jan 11.

### Game Description

| Section           | Strategy                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Short Description | Start strong, include unique selling points, end with tagline |
| About This Game   | Repeat 3-4 core gameplay themes consistently                  |
| Key Features      | Bullet points of what makes your game unique                  |
| Don't oversell    | Stick to what the game actually delivers                      |

### Steam Tags

> **Important:** Top 5 tags carry the most algorithmic weight. Set in Steamworks!

| Priority | Tag              | Why                                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Roguelite        | Core genre - players search for this   |
| 2        | Action Roguelike | Secondary genre term                   |
| 3        | Bullet Hell      | Describes the gameplay style           |
| 4        | Pixel Art        | Visual style - attracts pixel art fans |
| 5        | Survivors        | Sub-genre (if available as tag)        |
| 6        | Single Player    | Important for filtering                |
| 7        | Mythology        | Cultural hook - differentiator         |
| 8        | Indie            | Lower priority - too generic           |

## 🎮 Demo Requirements

### Demo Content Strategy

| Element     | Recommendation                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Length      | 10-15 minutes (enough to hook, not enough to satisfy) |
| Content     | Core gameplay loop only                               |
| Progression | NO shop access (removes meta-progression hook)        |
| End screen  | "Survive to dawn..." teaser + Wishlist CTA            |
| Time limit  | 10-minute run limit (leaves players wanting more)     |

### Demo Launch Timing

> **Best Practice:** Launch demo 2-4 weeks BEFORE Next Fest (by Feb 9)

**Why launch early?**

- Allows time for bug fixes from player feedback
- Enables content creators to stream before the event
- Builds wishlist velocity for better Next Fest visibility
- Gets you into the algorithm early

### Demo Submission Deadlines

| Deadline  | What For                          |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Jan 26    | Press Preview (optional, tight)   |
| **Feb 9** | **Final deadline for Next Fest**  |
| Feb 23    | Demo must be LIVE before 10am PDT |

## 📈 Maximizing Next Fest Impact

**Before Next Fest:**

- [ ] Share store page on social media
- [ ] Post in relevant subreddits (r/survivorslike, r/roguelites, etc.)

- [ ] Set up Discord for community building

**During Next Fest:**

- [ ] Monitor Steam discussions and respond quickly
- [ ] Share gameplay clips on social media with #SteamNextFest

### What's Changed from Previous Next Fests

Per the [official documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/upcoming_events/nextfest/2026february#dates):

- **No more official livestream** - Developer livestreams moved to independent tab
- **Revamped organization** - No longer genre tabs, page looks different
- **Livestreams are optional** - Focus on demo quality over streaming
